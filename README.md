##Descriptive Statistics for successful and failed kickstarter plays

*Failed Kickstarter play campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful campaigns

*An estimated $10,000 + budget for the campaign might be risky since the average goals and pledged amounts of successful campaigns are around $5,000

*Conversely, the mean and median of failed pledged amounts are much lower than those of successful pledges. This might indicate that there are factors other than money affecting the success of campaigns

*The standard donations are higher than the average and the distribution of successful plays fall around the third quartile which is around $5,000

*since the standard deviations are about three times the IQR, this might be an indication that some failed kickstarters had extremely high goals

##Musicals in GB
