# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

*The Client Louise is an up-and-coming playwright that is starting a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play 'Fever' and has a budget of over $10000. Louise is seeking help in planning her crowdfunding to ensure success based on historical data of other campaigns. Louise is also considering a campaign for a musical in Great Britain. The purpose is to analyze the performace of different campaigns to determine from the dataset how impactful each variable is, when to do it, how much to spend, popularity of the category and if it has high success rates.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

*To better understand when would be an ideal time to launch the campaign, a line chart illustrating number of outcomes and lauch dates was created. The chart has a clear illustration of the number of outcomes on the Y axis and months on the X axis to show which months have more success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

*Since Louise's current budget is over $10000, it was also important to illustrate if the dollar amount of the goal has an impact on the campaign outcome. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

*The data provided for the analysis had a lot of information of over 4000 different Campaigns in multiple countries, categories, dates, and years. It was very challenging to understand which factors were important.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

*Overall, the theater category is very popular as it makes 34% of the total outcomes. On avearge all categories have a success rate of 54% and theater's success rate is higher than the overall average at 61%. 

*The month with the most succesful Kickstarter campaigns is May, followed by June. Louise should consider starting a campaign during those months. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

*Although failed kickstarter play campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful ones and money may appear to impact the success rate, causation cannot be comfirmed. Since the mean and median of the pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, money might not have a direct impact on the success rate and other factors might need to be considered.  

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

*The dataset is limited in the sense that it does not include all factors that might affect a campaign. The results gathered from the dataset do not confirm a direct causation for success rate. Perhaps more detailed information on the demographics, cast and marketing techniques might provide more direction.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

*A regression analysis might give a more clear direction on how much each factor affects the success rate.
